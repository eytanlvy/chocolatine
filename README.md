# Chocolatine

This demonstrative project was developed as part of a cryptography course at the university. It focuses on studying Gentry's fully homomorphic encryption scheme, implemented in C. The project incorporates several optimizations for efficiency, such as a new key-generation method and batching techniques for encryption. The scheme is tested across various lattice dimensions to evaluate its performance and security levels. This implementation allows for homomorphic operations on encrypted data, maintaining privacy and enabling secure computations.

An in-depth study is provided in the report located in the `doc` folder of the repository.
